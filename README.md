## Technical Implementation

### Formula Used
The calculator uses the **Future Value of Annuity** formula with compound interest:

```
FV = PV(1+r)^n + PMT Ã— [((1+r)^n - 1) / r]
```

Where:
- FV = Future Value (target amount)
- PV = Present Value (current savings)
- PMT = Payment per period (monthly savings)
- r = Interest rate per period (monthly rate)
- n = Number of periods (months)

### Reality Check Logic
- **Very Realistic**: < 10% of average salary
- **Realistic**: 10-20% of average salary
- **Ambitious**: 20-35% of average salary
- **Very Challenging**: > 35% of average salary
